# ShinyApp
For my R Shiny project, I chose to analyze data documenting home sales within Nassau county. The data for home sales
was downloaded from a subscription based database for Long Island Realtors. Unfortunately, limitations with the numbers 
of observations my account could pull was restricted and therefore could only access three years worth of data.

The goal of my analysis of the data was to provide insight on the health of the real estate market in each school district or town 
of Nassau county as the markets can move independently of eachother. With a more thorough understanding,
Real estate agents will better equiped to assist buyers in deciding where in Nassau county suits their requirements and budget. It
will also increase the possibility of acquiring new listings from potential sellers by providing better insight on statistics of 
home sales in their town and school district.

My areas of analysis will be as follows:

Seasonal patterns in the market
Home prices by bedrooms in towns within school districts
Friction between buyers and sellers measured by days on the market
Consumer shifts in town preference measued by total sales
